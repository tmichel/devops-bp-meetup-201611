# Make baking easy with Packer

Baking or creating machines images is very useful but sometimes it can be quite
challenging. Using Packer to automate and smooth out most things around creating
new images makes the process a breeze. In this talk we will dive into Packer. We
will look at some usual use cases and (hopefully) see it in action. We will also
briefly talk about how baking images fits into the infrastructure at SSP and how
it can fit into anyones.
